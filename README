This is GNU utftpd, a replacement for the UNIX tftpd.

utftpd is a server for the trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP)
with finer grained access control then the standard UNIX tftpd. 
See the file FEATURES for more blurb.
I hope it will replace the tftpd of the GNU inetutils distribution.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the last releases.
See http://www.nrw.net/uwe/utftpd.html for updates.
See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation instructions.
See the file USAGE for a quick & dirty usage guide.
