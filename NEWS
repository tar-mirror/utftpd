0.2.4 - 1 November 1999

* some cleanup and minor bug fixes
* utftpd left SCCS lock files laying around in case of a failed put
  request.

0.2.3 - 5 September 1999

* the server now ignores garbage bytes at the end of a packet, unless
  there were tftp options.
* "must not write as root" check moved some lines up, to check against
  this before we create files (old version left 0 length files).

0.2.2 - 22 August 1999

* the server now uses adaptive timeout.
* the server now unlinks the received file if it was not received 
  completely.
* the server now includes a workaround for the 
  "Sorcerer's Apprentice Syndrome" (as it's called by RFC 1123)

0.2.1 - 2 May 1999

* rewrote configuration file handling. It's now much more 
  beautiful. 
  See sample.config for more information.
  The old stuff partially continues to work, except that
* the \ at the end of line (to split long lines into smaller pieces)
  will not work anymore. Sorry for that, but it's just too much
  pain to fix this.

0.2.0 - 2 May 1999
* understands a new experimental tftp option (revision).
* major internal interface cleanup.
* now reads version controlled files from a pipe. This means that
  it now can serve read request even when the same file is just uploaded.
* "lying around" copies of version controlled files will now be ignored.
* -l option (GNU inetutils) is now recognized (and ignored,
  utftpd logs by default).
* -n option (GNU inetutils) implemented. It's used to suppress NAK
  answers for "file not found". 
* Can now operate without a configuration file, in a mode largely 
  compatible with the traditional UNIX tftp server: Access control
  based on a list of directories given on the command line and the
  UNIX access bits (read/write for others). Therefore
* it may now be used as a drop-in replacement for GNU inetutils tftpd.

0.1.5 - 10 April 1999
* added RCS support. See the utftpd.conf manual page for a description 
  of the new configuration variables rcs-ci and rcs-co.
* improved SCCS support: unchecked files will not be checked in 
  (that's useful if your router saves his configuration regulary even 
  if it's unchanged). See the utftpd.conf manual page for a 
  description of the new configuration file variables sccs-clean and
  sccs-unget.
* improved checksuite to check SCCS/RCS handling.
* fixed some small bugs.
* improved compatibility (SCO 3.2v4.2, BSDI 3.1, Solaris 2.6 and 2.5.1,
  OpenBSD 2.4/alpha, HPUX 9.00/m68k).

0.1.4 - 5 April 1999
* configuration (cdb) file may now reside outside the chrooted area.
* understands RFC 2348 "blksize" option.
* understands RFC 2349 "timeout" option (but doesn't know about "tsize" 
  now).
* test suite added.
* documentation fixes.
* server now knows about wildcards.
* threw out some bugs and unused library files.
* there's now a client program (utftp).

0.1.3 - 28 March 1999
* uh, 0.1.2 didn't work because of those stupid last-moment-large-rewrite ... 
  Ok, that's why i tested it on my companies tftp server.
* smaller log things.

0.1.2 - 28 March 1999
* manual pages
* rpm fixed

0.1.1 - 21 March 1999
* put on cvs
