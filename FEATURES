This file describes the features GNU utftpd has.

1. support for IP based access control.
   utftpd can assign the right to read, create or overwrite a file
   (or files in a directory) on a per-host base.
2. support for revision control.
   utftpd can checkin/out files under SCCS or RCS version control.
   This was one of the main reasons to write it: version control is
   the easiest way to restore the configuration our IP routers 
   (Ascends, Ciscos) had yesterday or some weeks ago.
   This is, of course, optional.
3. support for the blksize option (RFC 2348).
   Allows packets larger than the usual 512 bytes, and is _somewhat_
   more efficient (especially on a directly connected network).
4. support for the timeout option (RFC 2349)
   No support for the tsize option of RFC 2349 now.
