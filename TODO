possibly a lot, but at least:
- clobber/noclobber TFTP options.
  "hey, i do not want to overwrite an existing file".
  Maybe together with an option "overwrite but backup / VC".
- tsize option
- "send me revision x" option (low priority) [done]
- "save as revision x" option (low priority) [done, considered useless]
